# Exploring-Lagos-State-LGAs-and-Venues
In this notebook we explored Lagos State using it's wikipedia page. We scraped the page using Beautiful soup and acquired its data using the request library and eventually we converted same from JSON format to a DataFrame using the json_normalize module. We used the foursquare API to get the details of venues for each location, using the geopy library to convert addresses to latitude and longitude.  Then we clustered Lagos state into 5 clusters using the K-means algorithm, and finally we displayed the Top venue categories in Lagos state using a word cloud object.
